** DONE Resources ID
** DONE Task ID
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-01-06 mar. 17:04]
** DONE Dependencies
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-01-09 Fri 22:40]
- The ORDERED property which allows you to state that the child tasks have to be
  completed in the order they appear (top most first).
- The BLOCKER property which allows you to state that a task depends on either a
  previous sibling ("previous-sibling") or any other task by stating the task_id
  property of the predecessor
** DONE Group of resources
CLOSED: [2015-01-11 Sun 10:25]
*** DONE for each group, check that nb of assigned task <= nb of members
CLOSED: [2015-01-11 Sun 10:25]
in example : tasks 11, 2, 7, 10
* TODO check for orgfile consistency and error reporting
** TODO missing mandatory properties
- [ ] Effort
- [ ] task_id
- [ ] resource_id
- [X] scheduling / dependencies / deadline / effort
** DONE duplicate ID on resources
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-01-06 mar. 17:40]
** DONE duplicate ID on tasks
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-01-06 mar. 17:40]
* DONE make a function to get if a resource or a resource in a group is available on a timeframe
CLOSED: [2015-01-11 Sun 20:08]
maybe a shell ? or option for the generated script ?
* STARTED let change scale (display of weeks instead of days)
** DONE Week
** DONE Month
** TODO Vacations are only drawn for daily scale
** TODO Quaterly
* SOMEDAY Support repetitive vacations (ie SCHEDULED DATE +1w or ++1w, +1y)
use yield ?
* DONE disconnect blocker assignation from task creation
CLOSED: [2015-01-11 Sun 10:49]
in order to have a task defined after.
* DONE option to align task titles on the left
CLOSED: [2015-06-06 Sat 23:54]
> just an additional recommendation: For longer Task titles, they don't fit well into the barchart itself.
> This is in particular the case when times are short (few months in my case). It would be therefore best,
> if all Task names would be simply aligned as a list left to the actual diagram (like a row label).
> Hope you understand what I mean.
* TODO is there a way to adapt the font properties of the Task descriptions?
* STARTED Milestones
is there a way to specify a special class of Tasks, namely a milestone?
Typically these are shown as diamonds.

Started : a milestone is on 3 lines.
** TODO duration of 1 is a problem for linked tasks (one day is lost)
** TODO draw dependency lines using blank lines before and after
- for milestone itself
- for task depending on milestone
* TODO change to the code for the horizontal alignment of the text
I changed "tx = 5" to "tx = 20". I would suggest to make this horizontal offset
an attribute of the project class. Then one can specify it as a property of each
project.
* TODO mode for showing critical path and tasks that can be moved without incidence
exemple : http://www.4csys.com/images/gantt_chart_2.jpg / http://www.4csys.com/gantt_chart.htm
* TODO use Pendulum : https://pendulum.eustace.io/
