# SCHEDULING POLICY DESCRIPTION:
#  This scheduling policy tries to schedule the task at the head of the
#  queue into the queue that will result in the earliest estimated
#  completion time for this task (factoring in the given start time
#  of the task taking into account the current busy status of a server).
#  This policy effectively attempts to provide the least utilization time 
#  (overall) for all the servers during the run.  For highly skewed
#  mean service times, this policy may delay the start time of a task until
#  a fast server is available.
