# STOMP Policies

This subdirectory contains *policies* to be used by STOMP during various simulations.  A policy in STOMP is generated by writing a small amount of Python code to fill out the contents of a base class *BaseSchedulingPolicy*.
This base class contains only three main routines:
 * init
 * assign_task_to_server
 * remove_task_from_server


## The 'init' Routine

The 'init' routine is largely boilerplate and mostly ensures that the policy class has copies of the servers, stomp_stats and stomp_params data for the current simulation run.  In most cases this routine will have the form as below:
```
    def init(self, servers, stomp_stats, stomp_params):
        self.stomp_stats  = stomp_stats
        self.stomp_params = stomp_params
        self.servers      = servers
        self.n_servers    = len(servers)
```
If the scheduling policy also required additional state or initialization, that could also be placed in the init routine.

### Inputs to 'init'
The inputs to the init routine are
 * the servers present in the current STOMP simulation
 * the statistics tracked by STOMP
 * the parameters to the current STOMP run

## The 'assign_task_to_server' Routine

The 'assign_task_to_server' routine is used to determine which server should be assigned the next task to be assigned.  This is the primary focus of the scheduler policy analysis at this time, and this STOMP distribution contains several example policies to help prospective policy writers to understand how one might make such a decision.  Note that the 'assign_task_to_server' has access to the servers of the current STOMP simulation (see the 'class Server' in stomp.py) and the set of tasks (see 'class Task' in the stomp.py code) and thus can make use of the members of those classes to determine to which server (from among the 'servers') the current task (which is at 'tasks[0]') should be scheduled.


### Inputs to 'assign_task_to_server'
The inputs to the 'assign_task_to_server' routine are:
 * The current simulation time
 * The current list of to-be-scheduled tasks

*Note:*
At this time, STOMP always schedules the first task in the waiting tasks list.  Support for scheduling tasks out of arrival order is a current TO-DO.


## The 'remove_task_from_server' Routine

The 'remove_task_from_server' routine is invoked when a task is retired from the simulation, and is primarily intended to allow the policy to clean up whatever internal data or state is necessary on task retirement.  The current example policies do not yet require any action at task retirement time, and so their 'remove_task_from_server' routine is as below:

```
   def remove_task_from_server(self, sim_time, server):
        pass
```

### Inputs to 'remove_task_from_server'
The inputs (arguments) to the 'remove_task_from_server' routine are:
 * the current simulation time
 * the server from which the task is being removed/finishing/retiring

## Requirements

STOMP requires:
 * Python 2.7
