# SCHEDULING POLICY DESCRIPTION:
#  This scheduling policy tries to schedule the task at the head of the
#  queue in its best scheduling option (i.e. fastest server). If the best
#  scheduling option isn't available, the policy will try to schedule the
#  task in less-optimal server platforms.  This policy tries to clear the
#  first task by allowing any (eligible) server to execute it even if it is
#  not the most optimal execution platform.
#  This is effectively a sorted earliest-out-of-queue approach, where the
#  task checks the fastest servers, then the next-fastest servers, etc. until
#  it finds one that is not busy.
